How to set up Heroku files
1. After downloading the heroku app and installation, we use the "heroku login"
command to log in to our heroku account and it will redirect us to their website.
2. we create a "Procfile" file and add the word "web: node app.js" in it
3. we add the "app.listen(port || localPort) " whereby localPort = 3000, port = process.env.PORT so that heroku can listen to 
4. we use  "git add ." and "git commit -m"message" "  to setup git locally
5. we use the "heroku create" to create our domain name in the website(it will be chosen at random but later we can change it )
